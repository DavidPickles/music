[Firth of Fifth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Fifth)
- By: Genesis 
- Album: Selling England by the Pound
- 1973
- On pretty much anyone's prog top 10, and definitely one of my favourites.

[Stairway to Heaven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven)
- By: Led Zeppelin
- Album: Led Zeppelin IV
- 1971
- Not everyone would count this as prog. But it's started appearing on prog lists, and I'm happy to be inclusive because it's a great song.
  
[School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_(Supertramp_song)
- By: Supertramp
- Album: Crime of the Century
- 1974
- Not a conventional choice this, but I wanted Supertramp on the list, and I like this song more than some of the more obvious choices.

[Comfortably Numb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfortably_Numb)
- By: Pink Floyd
- Album: The Wall
- 1979
- Some misguided people say Pink Floyd aren't prog. But they're wrong. I think their best albums are [Dark Side of the Moon]() and [Wish You Were Here](), and it's good to listen to them as a whole. This song isn't on either, but stands alone.
  
[Can you Understand?]
- By: Renaissance
- Album: [Ashes are Burning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashes_Are_Burning)
- 1973
- An unconventional choice this. But I've been enjoying it a lot recently, and it's my list so there you are.

[Bohemian Rhapsody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody)
- By: Queen
- Album: A Night at the Opera
- 1975
- Including this in a prog list would upset some people, but I can't think of any reason not to, other than that it's very popular.

[The Court of the Crimson King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Court_of_the_Crimson_King)
- By: King Crimson
- Album: In the Court of the Crimson King
- 1969
- At least one track from this album has to be included on every prog top 10, by law.

[Shadow of the Hierophant]()
- By: Steve Hackett
- Album: Voyage of the Accolyte
- 1975
- A very unconventional choice. But I think it's a classic.

[Roundabout]()
- By: Yes
- Album: Fragile
- 1971
  
[Aqualung]()
- By: Jethro Tull
- Album: Aqualung
- 1971
